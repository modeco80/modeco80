## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lily, a trans girl who does cool things sometimes.

I mainly write in C++, although sometimes I do C (not willingly, since it's 2021, of course).

If I *really need to*, I know some TypeScript/JavaScript and C#, but do *not* prefer them by a long shot.
 
I bounce around lots of projects, some (currently) private, some public.

Check out my [blog](https://github.com/modeco80/modeco80/tree/master/blog) I sometimes add posts to!
