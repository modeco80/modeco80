## Hi! 👋

I'm Lily, a trans girl who does cool things sometimes.

I mainly write in C++, although sometimes I do C (not willingly, since it's 2021, of course).

If I *really need to*, I know some TypeScript/JavaScript and C#, but do *not* prefer them by a long shot.

And no, I don't use Rust, and if you make even a meme RIIR issue, you will get bent.
 
I bounce around lots of projects, some private, some public.
