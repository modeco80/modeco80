## I may be moving away from Discord

The title of this post pretty much sums it up right away; I'm thinking about going away from Discord for real.

Recent events have proven that Discord has decided to not listen to its userbase, ignored accessibility problems, 
and straight up *lying* that they're going to attempt to fix it, all the while completely removing accessibility features.

To set it straight, I've seen many of the scandals including:

- When they decided to kill GameWisp emotes just to start Nitro (and lie about that "core features" garbage)
- When they literally fucking had pedos on the trust and safety team
- When they decided to make /api/v6/science the ACK endpoint for a short time.

and other stupid things, and those happening one by one were.. not *bad* but not exactly the best look for Discord.

This recent attempt to I guess look favorable to Sony has been one of the longest points of Discord simply not listening to its userbase.

**And I'm done with it**. To put it simply; I've had enough of this bullshit. 

It doesn't matter that Discord is free, is easy to use, or whatever shill argument i've been told. What matters is if they **LISTEN** to feedback.

They've made their choices clear, so I feel making mine clear is fair enough.


Fuck Discord.
