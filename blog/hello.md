## Hello!

Well, this is going to be my attempt at doing some sort of blog thing. I hope so, at least.

Right now, these are flat md's in modeco80/modeco80, however I'll probably see about converting
these using some jekyll magic or something to something GH pages won't flip out about,
maybe encoding creation date from first commit file exists in or something
